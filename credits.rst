Credits and Resources
=====================

Open Source Software relies on collaboration, and I'm more than happy to
receive help from other developers. Here I'll list the main contributions.

* Adolfo Jayme-Barrientos, aka fitojb_ for the Spanish translation

Also, I'd like to thank everyone who contributes to the development of
**When** by commenting, filing bugs, suggesting features and testing.
Every kind of help is welcome.

The top panel icons and the emblems used in the application were selected
within Google's `Material Design`_ icon collection.

The application icon_ has been created by Rafi at GraphicsFuel_.

Resources
=========

As said above, this software is designed to run mainly on Ubuntu and the
chosen framework is *Python 3.x* with *PyGObject* (*GTK 3.0*); the interface is
developed using the *Glade* interface designer. The resources I found useful
are:

* `Python 3.x Documentation`_
* `PyGTK 3.x Tutorial`_
* `PyGTK 2.x Documentation`_
* `PyGObject Documentation`_
* `GTK 3.0 Documentation`_
* `DBus Documentation`_
* `pyinotify Documentation`_

The guidelines specified in UnityLaunchersAndDesktopFiles_ have been roughly
followed to create the launcher from within the application.

Many hints and valuable information have been found on StackOverflow_ and the
other sites in the StackExchange_ network.
